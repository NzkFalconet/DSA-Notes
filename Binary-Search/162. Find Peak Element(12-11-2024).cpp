Logic

1. Brute Force -

a. We can simply itterate through the array and find that element which is strictly greater than both of its neighbours.

TC - O(N)
SC - O(1)

2. Optimal Approach -

a. We can use binary search for this problem because there is always at least one peak element in the array.
b. For example, in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], even though it is strictly increasing, we consider the elements beyond the first and last index as -âˆž. Therefore, 5 is a peak element.
c. We can start with two pointers: one at the beginning (0) and one at the end (nums.size() - 1) of the array.
d. Calculate the mid index. If the element at mid + 1 is greater than the element at mid, then mid + 1 could be a peak, so we move the left pointer to mid + 1.
e. Otherwise, we move the right pointer to mid, as mid might be a peak element.
f. The condition l < r is used because we are always checking mid against mid + 1.

TC - O(logN)
SC - O(1)
